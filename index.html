It is to introverts\u2014Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve\nWozniak\u2014that we owe many of the great contributions to society.   In Quiet,\nSusan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much\nwe lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the\ntwentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture.\nShe also introduces us to successful introverts\u2014from a witty, high-octane public\nspeaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman\nwho quietly taps into the power of questions.

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more\ndeliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary\ncapabilities\u2014and also the faults and biases\u2014of fast thinking, and reveals the\npervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The\nimpact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the\ndifficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges\nof properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive\nbiases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next\nvacation\u2014each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems\nwork together to shape our judgments and decisions.  Engaging the reader in a\nlively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot\ntrust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He\noffers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our\nbusiness and our personal lives\u2014and how we can use different techniques to guard\nagainst the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.
